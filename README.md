# The Camp — Steam Game

**The Camp** is a 3D first-person horror game where the player must explore an abandoned campsite and collect 50 tents while avoiding enemy creatures that patrol the area.

## Gameplay Overview
The player spawns in a forested environment and must navigate through multiple campsite areas to locate tents scattered around the map. As the player progresses, environmental clues and story notes reveal what happened in the area, adding narrative context and tension.

Enemy AI units roam the map and react to player presence. Getting caught results in a game over.

## Development & Assets
- Built with **Unity**
- 3D assets and props modeled in **Blender**
- Enemy AI implemented using basic state machines and path-following
- Player interactions (pickup, inspection, stamina)
- Environment built using Unity terrain tools and tree systems
- Story delivered through collectible notes

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Platform:** PC (Steam)
- **Art Tools:** Blender
- **Audio:** (optional to include if you used SFX sources)
- **Versioning:** (optional, e.g., GitHub / local)

## What I Learned
- AI behavior implementation in a 3D environment
- Creating atmospheric environments (fog density, lighting, time of day)
- Terrain generation and automatic vegetation placement
- Asset import pipeline from Blender → Unity
- UI & player interaction systems
- Publishing and releasing a commercial build on **Steam**

## Notes
This was my first commercial PC game released on Steam, and helped me understand both production and distribution pipelines for desktop games.
